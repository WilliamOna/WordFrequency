# WordFrequency
Write a Java program to calculate word frequency.
Given a piece of text, it should output each word in the text and the number of times it occurred.
The words should be sorted by frequency, in descending order. Words with the same frequency
can be in any order.
For example for the input “the cat is in the bag”, output should be:
2 the
1 cat
1 is
1 in
1 bag
